|PhaserEditor|_ is built with web technologies. You can run it on your desktop, your private network, or in the cloud.

`Play Phaser Editor 2D in our cloud service <https://play.phasereditor2d.com>`_

We provide two different types of distributions: the `Server distribution <server-installation.html>`_ and the `ElectronJS-based distribution <install-electron.html>`_. Each type of distribution is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The server distribution has a much smaller size and can be `configured to run as a desktop application <./install-server.html#application-mode>`_ if Google Chrome is available in your OS. However, many users love to download and execute it as a desktop-application, with zero-configuration. For those users, the ElectronJS-based distribution is the one we recommend.
