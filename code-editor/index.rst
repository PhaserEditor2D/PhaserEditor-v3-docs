|PhaserEditor|_ is focused mainly on provide design tools. You can code your game using advanced third-party editors. 

You can use any coding editor, but we recommend |vscode|_. Actually, the projects generated by the IDE are full compatible with that editor and includes the configuration files.

However, we included code editors inside |PhaserEditor|_ for two reasons:

* You can do a quick preview of the code.

* If you are working remotely, like is the case of the |PlayPhaserEditor|_ service, and you cannot use a local editor.

The code editing editors are based on the |MonacoEditor|_. It is the same component used by |vscode|_.

The `JavaScript editor <js-editor.html>`_ has more features, allowing |PhaserAPI|_ auto-completion, cross-file auto-completion and more.
