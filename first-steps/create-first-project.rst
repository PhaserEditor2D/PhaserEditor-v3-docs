Create your first project

The first time you open the IDE in the browser it shows the `New Project Dialog <../workbench/projects.html#project-templates>`_. This dialog displays the project templates available in the server. Select one of the templates, write the name of the project and press the **Create Project** button:

The new project is created and shown in the workbench:
